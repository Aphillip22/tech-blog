  # Description
  This app is a CMS-style blog site where developers and aspiring developers can publish blog posts and comment on each other's posts. It follows an MVC style structure, uses Handlebars.js as a template engine, and Sequelize as the ORM. Users can read blog and comment posts but will be asked to login to create either. For authentication, this app uses the Express-Session npm.
  # Installation
  To install the dependencies, the user will need to run the command 'npm i' or 'npm install.' Once the dependencies are installed a .env file must be created with the database name, user, and password for mySQL.
  # Usage
  The intended usage of this application is to communicate with other developers regarding industry-specific information.
